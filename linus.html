<p> This is Linus Torvalds. He made linux in 1991 as a pet project. It started as a port minix beacuse minix users found it difficult to use. </p>
<p> In the early days of Linux, Torvalds incudled a GNU GPL licence in the 0.0.1
 release orginaly under it's own licence that did not allow commercial entities to profit from the project. This is a arguably what allowed the project grow as much as it did.</p>
<p> Torvalds has written a large percentage of the code in the Linux kernal. As the project got larger over the years he has written less and less but still over sees the project and merages code to the kernal.</p>
<p> He is still somewhat active in the devlopment but stepped back from the project in 2018 after many years of abusive emails about him self and the Linux project.</p>
